The prompt that was used detailed chatgpt to finish the assignment to create a webpage using html and css for a specific theme.

AI responded with the HTML Code and CSS code, the only adjustment that i had made so far was inputting an image of the theme. 

Travered through the code to get the website looking better. I used a gif int he bacgkround, changed the font color to white, added more photos and edited the different sections.
